This is a C++ program to fetch energies from Molpro.
I made it in such a way that it is required you use a Molpro table, and mark it.
In other words, in your MOLPRO code you should have for example:

 text,TABLE
 {table,R,ehf
 digits,3,16}

Of course, you are free to change the table as you wish.

The program currently requires you to name your outputfiles in a specific way. This is referred to as a key and the jobname.

The key is defined by the name of the MOLPRO outputfiles. The MOLPRO output should be named as "$jobname-$key.out".
The key should be shaped as ##-##-##-##-... where ## represents a number or a word/letter-number combination. Example (in 3d): potential-R1-P12-T5.out. Where "potential" represents the job name.
Please also note that it is CRUCIAL that the molpro output is in a table as defined in molpro itself. Molpro can generate a nice table with the table command. 
The line where a table is made, should be directly preceded by a line that says "text,table" in the input. This is how the program knows where to look for the energies.

Considering input arguments:
The first input argument should be the jobname you have used. Jobname is defined above. The second and third arguments should define the dimensions of your table.
However, if you wish to copy a different row from your output, you should use this row number instead of the number of rows.
For example you can call the program using:

ffindE2 jobname 2 3

in order to get the second row from your table, which also has 3 collumns.
